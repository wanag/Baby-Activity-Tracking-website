1. The Entry & Setup Pages

Page 1: The Welcome Page (Replaces "Login")

    Purpose: The very first screen a user sees. It directs them to either create a new log or open an existing one. This is designed for simplicity and avoids a "login" barrier.

    Key Elements:

        A clean, calming welcome message.

        Button 1: "Create a New Baby Profile" (Leads to the "Create Profile Page").

        Button 2: "Select Existing Profile" (This shows a list or cards of a baby's profiles already created on that device/browser, e.g., "Liam's Profile," "Mia's Profile").

Page 2: Create Profile Page

    Purpose: A one-time setup screen for a new user to enter their baby's details.

    Key Elements:

        A simple form asking for:

            Baby's Name

            Baby's Date of Birth

        A "Save & Start Logging" button that, once clicked, creates the profile and redirects the user directly to the Dashboard.

2. The Core Daily-Use Pages

Page 3: The Dashboard (Home Screen)

    Purpose: The command center for quick logging and immediate status checks. This is the page users will see most.

    Key Elements:

        Baby Info Header (Your Edit): A new section at the very top of the page showing:

            Baby's Name: (e.g., "Liam's Day")

            Baby's Age: (e.g., "6 Weeks, 3 Days")

            Today's Date: (e.g., "Logging for: Thursday, Nov 13") This confirms all logs will be associated with this date.

        Active Timer: A highly visible section showing any in-progress timers (e.g., "Sleep: 45 minutes").

        Large Activity Buttons: The main focus. Big, clear buttons for "Feed," "Sleep," "Diaper," and "Play." Tapping one opens the Log Activity Modal.

        "At-a-Glance" Feed: A simple list of the last 3-5 activities to answer "When did I last...?"

Page 4: Log Activity Modals (Pop-ups)

    Purpose: These are not full pages. They are quick pop-up windows that appear over the Dashboard for rapid data entry, keeping the user in context.

    Key Elements:

        Log Sleep Modal: "Start Sleep Timer" button OR "Log Past Sleep" (with start/end time inputs).

        Log Diaper Modal: Simple buttons: "Wet," "Dirty," "Both."

        Log Feed Modal: Tabs for "Bottle," "Breast," or "Solid," with appropriate inputs (amount, timers, etc.).

        All modals default to "Now" for the time but allow for easy editing.

3. The Review & Management Pages

Page 5: The Timeline (or "Logbook")

    Purpose: To see the full daily history and to edit or delete mistakes.

    Key Elements:

        Calendar View (Your Edit): A compact, visual way to select the date. This could be a horizontal, swipeable "week view" at the top or a small "Calendar" icon that opens a full-month pop-up. This is much faster than tapping arrows repeatedly.

        Full Chronological List: A complete, time-ordered list of every event logged for the selected day.

        Edit/Delete Buttons: A clear, simple way (e.g., a "..." icon) next to each entry to make corrections.

Page 6: Summaries (or "Trends")

    Purpose: To help parents see patterns and answer questions like, "Is the baby getting enough sleep?"

    Key Elements:

        Date Range Selector: "Last 24 Hours," "Last 3 Days," "Last Week."

        Simple Data Visuals:

            Daily Totals: Large numbers for "Total Sleep," "Total Feedings," "Total Diapers."

            Simple Charts: A basic bar chart showing sleep duration per day for the last week.

Page 7: Settings

    Purpose: Simplified to manage the baby's details.

    Key Elements:

        Baby's Profile: An area to edit the "Baby's Name" or "Date of Birth" (in case of a mistake during setup).
